drones4all Public Open Source Project ||
========================================

Welcome to the largest Drone open source project for improving the way drones fly safer. You can contribute verifyng sections of the code provided, creating your own by using our SKD or bringing your own ideas to the community.

Our main objective is to create a project that will allow drones to mantain stability while flying. If selected, sections or complete portions of your code can make it to our final firmware which will be rewarded with cash prices we have for you.

We thank you for your time and cooperation with this initiative and hope to have you as a family member real soon!
